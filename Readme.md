Assignment 1:
Variable names can have underscores at the front, middle, or back of the name.  No spaces.

Assignment 2:
'=' can be used to change a variable that was previously declared.  Must have used 'let' to declare the variable at some prior point before trying to set that particular name to a value with the '=' operator.

Assignment 3:
In order to create a constant variable, use 'const' in the exact same was as you would use 'let'.  In the event that you try to use the added feature in Assignment 2 to change the value of a constant, an error message will print and the value (-1) will be returned.
